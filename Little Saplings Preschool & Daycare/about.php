								<p>Preschool is golden period of child's life. Admission to Playgroup and Nursery can be taken round the year. However it is advisable to take admissions before commencement of academic year starting from June. The child gets more time period in preschool and more exposure to the toys.</p>
								<p>Little Saplings Preschool conducts two classes for children, i.e. Play group and Nursery</p>
								<p><b>Playgroup children age grouping is from 2 to 3 years</b></p>
								<p><b>Nursery children age grouping is from 3 to 4 years</b></p>
								<p>Parents are requested to visit the school, meet the management staff on any working day to have complete understanding of school.</p>
								<p>Taking admission at our preschool will be a great gift by parents to the child for his golden age.</p>
