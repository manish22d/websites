										<p>It is a proud and great moment in one's life to become parent.  Proper upbringing of child is a prime responsibility.</p>
										<p>It is a pleasure to see and witness the growth of child from very nascent age to a grown up person. The child is a future citizen of the country handling and taking care of future responsibility. The early childhood from the age of 2 years to 6 years of child life is very important as the child starts learning and witnessing the new environment in addition to environment at home.</p>

It is a pleasure to see and witness the growth of child from very nascent age to a grown up person. The child is a future citizen of the country handling and taking care of future responsibility.</blockquote>
											
										<p>Whatever the child observes, learns, listens is all impregnated in child's memory for the whole life. The learning capacity is so high the child at this age can pickup many languages, physical activity like swimming, cycling, which once learned, child never forgets. Child is always keen to learn new things and demonstrate the things learned. We as parents have to judicially use these valuable years of children's life to give exposure for their learning of language, sensorial, mathematics, cognitive, social skills through means of playful learning. A qualitative preschool offers these means of learning  to children, so that the journey becomes joyful and stress free towards learning. The teachers in such quality preschool are facilitators rather than teachers as we grown ups know conventionally.</p>
										<p>The child has tremendous capacity to learn new things as per child's liking and ability Lot of playtime is provided in preschool and the space for playing also need to be available in preschool. As a responsible parent, we must gift this preschool learning to child so that learning becomes a fun and child enters the formal schooling with confidence. Let us commit to ourselves as responsible parent to give this valuable gift of Preschool years to our child. We as parents in our childhood life have gone through rote learning. Our entire education system has been affected and changed as we were ruled by many invaders, wherein they imposed the education system, wherein persons with ability to do repeated works can be produced. Overcoming all these challenges, we have improved phenomenally and start building the country for better future. Focused attention to child's learning and growth needs to be given from an early age of 2 years.</p>
										<p>In qualitative preschool the exposure to various means of learning and planned lessons enable child to explore and learn new things with pleasure. It need to be remembered the play time meets the physical, intellectual, language, emotional and social needs of child growth. As parents, we can provide this Preschool time period to child and ensure the child enters formal schooling with confidence and pleasure. I am responsible parent and I give my child a valuable gift of preschool years for happy learning.</p>
